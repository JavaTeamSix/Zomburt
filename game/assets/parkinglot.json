The faint NORTHerly breeze brings the scent of Malik’s Combination Taco & Schnitzel Restaurant.  Somehow that place is still open.  Only thing you’ve ever tried from there is the Vegan Carnitas Quesa-Double - which, despite its name was a somewhat respectable 72/100.\nTo your EAST… is a store\nTo your WEST…[coming soon]\nTo the SOUTH is an open field.  There appears to be an orderly protest going on over there.  For some reason everyone looks to be stumbling.  And they’re not really chanting so much as they’re moaning and groaning.  Maybe it was a marathon overnight Protest Ultra?\nFor reasons that are totally not based on the limitations of the code written thus far for this game you feel drawn to the store, don’t you?",

"Ok ok, we’re sorry.  Please don’t go.  Its just that those other levels aren’t ready yet.  Soon we’ll have a cool “Freemium” prompt that will let you purchase access, but the payment gateway setup is tricky so let’s just go the store, ok?"
